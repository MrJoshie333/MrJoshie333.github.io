    <p> Here's some quotation stuff! <br>
        
        A quote from the wise mouth of Joshua Santy: <blockquote cite="mrjoshie333.github.io/index.html">
            Hi, I am Joshu. That's right, Joshu, not Joshua. You thought I made an editing mistake. Haha you are greatly mistaken.
        </blockquote>
        In other news, Joshua Santy was secretly recorded and was caught saying this shocking statement:
        <q>
            Oh my gosh I can't believe I'm so short. I mean, I'm like 5'8. It's not that short. Right? Right??? OH NO
        </q>
        <br>
        One day, Josh hopes to work for Raytheon, which is often abbreviated <abbr title="Raytheon">RTX</abbr>. 
        <br> If you have any questions to ask Joshua, here is some of his contact info:<br>
